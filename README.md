# Exploiting plume structure to decode gas source distance using metal-oxide gas sensors

### Supplementary code

This repository contains code to reproduce all figures from the manuscript:

Michael Schmuker, Viktor Bahr, Ram√≥n Huerta (2016): Exploiting plume structure to decode gas source distance using metal-oxide gas sensors.

## Getting started

1. Download the data that A. Vergara and colleagues have collected and published in 2013 from the
[UCI Machine learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+arrays+in+open+sampling+settings)).

2. Extract the archive into the same top-level directory that you cloned this repository in. For example,
if you clone this repo into `/home/user/plume_distance/`, you should extract it into the same directory. That directory should afterwards contain at least the two entries `exploiting_plume_structure` (i.e., this repository),
and `WTD_upload` (the dataset).

3. Go to the `ipnotebooks` directory, fire up an ipython/jupyter notebook session, and you should be good to go.

Make sure you have all dependencies installed:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplot`
- `tables`
- `sklearn`
- `mdp`
- `pandas`

We recommend the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) because it made scientific python a breeze on every computer and platform we were working on so far.
