**Abstract**

The `plumy` framework, written in python 2.7 provides the means to
load (`plumy.utils`), analyze and visualize (`plumy.plot`) the data
generated by A. Vergara et al. in 2013 (available on 
[UCI Machine learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+arrays+in+open+sampling+settings)).
