**Abstract**

The `plumy` framework, written in python 2.7 provides the means to
load (`plumy.utils`), analyze and visualize (`plumy.plot`) the data
generated by A. Vergara et al. in 2013 (available on 
[UCI Machine learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+arrays+in+open+sampling+settings)).

**Usage**

Plumy needs the following 3rd party python packages to run properly:

+ `NumPy`
+ `SciPy`
+ `MatplotLib`
+ `pandas`
+ (Optional: `ipython`)

To get familiar with the usage have a look at the *ipython notebooks* in
the `'./ipnotebooks'` folder.
